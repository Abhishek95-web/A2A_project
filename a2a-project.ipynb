It's a fantastic bodyweight exercise that requires no equipment, making it accessible anywhere!\n\nFor beginners, aiming for 10-20 reps is a good starting point. Focus on maintaining good form:\n\n*   **Starting Position:** Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the floor, fingers pointing forward. Extend your legs back, balancing on your toes. Your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.\n*   **Lowering Phase:** Keeping your core engaged and body straight, lower yourself towards the floor by bending your elbows. Aim to get your chest as close to the floor as possible.\n*   **Pushing Phase:** Push back up to the starting position, extending your arms fully but without locking your elbows.\n\n**Important Tips:**\n\n*   **Form over Quantity:** It's much better to do fewer push-ups with perfect form than many with poor form. This prevents injuries and ensures you're effectively working the target muscles.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel any pain, stop the exercise.\n*   **Progression:** As you get stronger, you can increase the number of reps, do more sets, or try variations like incline or decline push-ups.\n\nHow does that sound?
